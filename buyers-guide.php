      Dubai</h2>

    <div class="guide-timeline">

      <!-- Step 1 -->
      <div class="timeline-item left">
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h6>Set Your Budget & Choose Location</h6>
          <p>
            Clarify your budget early, accounting for 4% DLD fee, 2% agency fee, and mortgage charges.
            Focus on freehold areas open to foreign buyers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-marker">1</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 2 -->
      <div class="timeline-item right">
        <div class="timeline-marker">2</div>
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h6>Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage</h6>
          <p>
            Before viewing properties, secure mortgage pre-approval. Expect 20% down payment under AED 5M,
            and 30% above. A good advisor ensures favorable terms and guidance.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 3 -->
      <div class="timeline-item left">
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h6>Work With a RERA-Certified Advisor</h6>
          <p>
            Only deal with RERA-certified brokers. Request their BRN, verify via DLD tools, and ensure full
            transparency.
            Your agent should act in your best interest.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-marker">3</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 4 -->
      <div class="timeline-item right">
        <div class="timeline-marker">4</div>
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h6>Make an Offer with Confidence</h6>
          <p>
            When ready, move fast. With mortgage pre-approval and deposit ready, your offer holds weight.
            A solid advisor helps negotiate terms and strengthen your position.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 5 -->
      <div class="timeline-item left">
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h6>Sign MoU & Submit Deposit</h6>
          <p>
            Sign Form F (MoU), issue a 10% current-dated cheque to seller and a commission cheque.
            Includes a 14-day cooling-off period for added security.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-marker">5</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 6 -->
      <div class="timeline-item right">
        <div class="timeline-marker">6</div>
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h6>Hire a Professional Conveyancer</h6>
          <p>
            A conveyancer manages paperwork, verifies ownership, checks for liabilities, and protects your interests
            throughout the transaction—ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 7 -->
      <div class="timeline-item left">
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h6>Secure Developer’s NOC</h6>
          <p>
            Seller obtains No Objection Certificate from the developer, confirming no outstanding service charges
            and clearing the path for final ownership transfer at DLD.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-marker">7</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 8 -->
      <div class="timeline-item right">
        <div class="timeline-marker">8</div>
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h6>Block the Property (If Mortgage Exists)</h6>
          <p>
            Seller gets liability letter from their bank. You submit four manager’s cheques—for mortgage clearance,
            property price, DLD fee, and agency commission.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 9 -->
      <div class="timeline-item left">
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h6>Transfer Ownership at DLD</h6>
          <p>
            On transfer day, buyer, seller, agent, and conveyancer meet. Manager’s cheques are exchanged,
            ownership is registered, and you receive keys and title deed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-marker">9</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 10 -->
      <div class="timeline-item right">
        <div class="timeline-marker">10</div>
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h6>Set Up Utilities & Move In</h6>
          <p>
            Transfer utilities (DEWA, cooling, gas, etc.) into your name. Once done, move in or rent out
            your new property and start enjoying returns.

                1. Should I invest in an off-plan or ready-to-move-in property?

              <div class="accordion-body">
                Both have their advantages. Off-plan offers lower entry prices and flexible payment plans, while ready
                properties let you move in or rent out immediately. The right choice depends on your goals—short-term
                use or long-term capital growth.

              <div class="accordion-body">
                Freehold gives you full ownership of the property and land. Leasehold allows you to own the property for
                a set period (usually 99 years), but not the land. In Dubai, most expats prefer freehold in designated
                zones.
